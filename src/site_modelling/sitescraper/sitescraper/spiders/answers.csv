How did water get into the ocean?,"Volcanoes erupting left vapor in the air which eventually froze over then defrosted and continued in that cycle.. 
It came from volcanoes. Early in its history, the earth was under constant volcanism, and the water vapor condensed as the planet cooled. Even today, millions of tonnes of water are added to planet's surface each year by volcanos.. 
These days, some of the water from volcanos is recycled, that is seeped into rock and reheated, but most is emerging for the first time.. 
Additionally, some scientists believe that a contributor to the amount of water on Earth was asteroid bombardment with their accompanying H20. 		"
Why are oceans important?,"O.K, someone put ""because it is some animal's habitat"" and that isn't acceptable.   The ocean isn't just supporting marine life, it supports our life. It's the largest water source in the world, providing almost all of our rain. You like fish, crab, lobster? You wouldn't be able to enjoy these tasty foods if it wasn't for the ocean. And don't even get me started on water pollution and how it could kill every animal in the sea! Plastic bags, for instance, to a hungry sea turtle it's going to look like a jellyfish (and yes they eat jelly fish.) And the mangroves! The mangroves are the things standing between you and tsunami's. The ocean does so many things for us the explanations on why it's important go on forever.    One last thing. The ocean needs help. Go outside and look at the ocean, or the beach even. Try and count how much trash you see. Now this is different for private beaches or beaches that people are payed to clean up. Styrofoam cups, and coolers, don't EVER decompose. Same thing with plastics. Some do decompose but it takes almost 1,000 years. Which is almost equivalent to 111 human lives. Please, I know you may not belive it but just double checking to see if you've picked up all of your trash after a beach party will do so much. It's little things like that that will save the oceans. 		"

What is in the Ocean water?,"Seawater is a mixture of various salts and water. Only six elements and   compounds comprise about 99% of sea salts: chlorine, sodium, sulfur, magnesium, calcium and potassium. The relative abundance of the major salts in seawater is constant regardless of the ocean. Only the amount of water in the mixture varies because of differences between ocean basins because of regional differences in freshwater loss (evaporation) and gain (runoff and precipitation).   The chlorine ion makes up 55% of the salt in seawater. 		"

Why is the ocean an important part of the watercycle?,"Yes it is a very important part of the watercycle here is a bit of an explanation i wrote  Do you know that we are still drinking the same water that the dinosaurs did?! The water cycle has been happening ever since the start of the world and will proberly still be happening for another 10 thousand years. The next time you have a glass of water just think, every drop of water in that glass would have seen so many amazing things, when apes roamed the land to today when TVs and electronics ruled the world, on it's continuos journey in the water cycle .    The water cycle has no starting point but we will start with the oceans because that is were most of the earth's water existes (97% percent to be exact and that's alot)! The surface of the ocean is heated up by the sun - only the surface is heated up; the oceans are very deep, miles and miles sometimes, and the suns rays aren't strong enough to penatrate all the way through to the bottem. Some of the water is evaporated into the air and then turns into a gas called water vapour. Ice and water can sublimate straight into the air, and water from  Evapotranspiration , which is water transpired from plants and evaporated from the soil. These things are important parts of the water cycle as well...............  Sublimate is when snow or ice changes into water vapor in the air without melting into water first. The opposite of sublimation is ""deposition"", where water vapor changes directly into ice---such a snowflakes and frost.  Next, rising air currents take the vapor up into the atmosphere. The vapor rises and the air gets colder, consequently causing the vapor to turn into clouds. This process is called condensation.  When the sun warm's the surface of the earth, the earth warms the air near it. This warm air is always rising, and cooler air is coming in to replace it. This moving air is called wind. Wind is the thing that pushes clouds along in till they reach land. When the wind comes to a mountain it heads upwards taking the cloud with it. As the cloud gets higher and higher it also gets colder and colder, then there's precipitation. . 
Precipitation happens when the air is really cold so it can't hold so much water, and the cloud is full of water droplets that the air can't hold so it rain, but it might not be rain when it reaches the earth........    and in the end the water water reterns back to the ocean (river lake whatever) and the water cycle starts again! :) 		"

What are the importance of ocean current?,"The importance of ocean currents to the local ecosystem: 1. Ocean currents help in shaping the features of the earth. The forces of waves influence and form the physical structure of the costs. Sand is also distribute by ocean currents to its shore, which normally consists of small rocks, minerals, plants animals. All these together form the local ecosystem of that particular area. 2. Ocean currents help in influencing weather and temperature of its local ecosystem by absorbing, storing and moving heat, carbon and water. Any disruption in the currents causes disorder in the local ecosystem. for example according to a report, in 2005, a delay in the arrival of a seasonal, nutrient-rich ocean current off the coast of Northern California and Oregon led to reduced influx of barnacle and mussel larvae to rocky shores, thus disturbing the coastal ecosystem of that area .The report also suggested that the change in ocean currents had several ecological consequences like, high ocean temperatures, low nutrient levels, and low abundance of phytoplankton. 3. Ocean currents help in maintaining the marine life. Ocean surface is warm on the top and cold in its lower levels. The upwards movements of its currents brings cold nutrient-rich water from the depths. Marine life thrives in this water. Many organisms in ocean use ocean currents as a conveyor belt, spending their larval and adult life in various parts of the ocean, all because of the motion of currents. This upwelling also supports half of the world fisheries. Another example to highlight the importance of currents is to see the currents pattern in Australia. In spring season ,the warm currents flowing south along the west and east coasts allow coral reefs to grow at low latitudes and thus keep swimming a pleasant experience. One has to understand that any change in ocean currents has far reaching implication on the ecological balance, so its knowledge is important to an individual in order to make responsible decision regarding the resources of ocean.

How did ancient geography divide the world?,"Answer    . 
Pangaea  or  Pangea  (derived from Î Î±Î³Î³Î±Î¯Î±, Greek meaning 'all earth') is the supercontinent that existed during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras about 250 million years ago, before each of the component continents were separated into their current configuration.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pangaea_continents.png  . 
Pangaea is believed to have been a C-shaped landmass that spread across the equator. The body of water that was believed to have been enclosed within the resulting crescent has been named the Tethys Sea. Owing to Pangaea's massive size, the inland regions appear to have been very dry, due to the lack of precipitation. The large supercontinent would potentially have allowed terrestrial animals to migrate freely all the way from the South Pole to the North Pole.. 
The vast ocean that once surrounded the supercontinent of Pangaea has been named Panthalassa. Pangaea is believed to have broken up about 180 million years ago (mya) in the Jurassic Period, first into two supercontinents (Gondwana to the south and Laurasia to the north), thereafter into the continents as we understand them today.

It has been hijacked by the nuclear industry for shock tactics, but it is Geology mostly too great for our control although we could limit earthquake damage in many ways. We can research and petrology assists that, some tectonic events are too deep seated for any but seismic studies and others have to rely on extrusions of minerals and surface exposed structure plane interface to get an essay on tectonic formations, let alone a complete understanding.

Buod ng kabanata 4 sa Florante at Laura?,"Aralin 4           Halina, Laura Ko        Ang araling ito ay tungkol sa pangungulila ni Florante kay Laura! Ang sabi ni Florante ay katiwala at kasintahan siya ni Laura, Hindi raw niya akalain na sasayangin lamang ni Laura ang maraming luha na inalay nito para sa kanya at tinagurian pa siya nito ng ""giliw"" dahil si Florante ang lunas ng mga sakit na nararanasan ni Laura. Kapag umaalis o inuutusan si Florante ni Haring Linseo na pumunta sa ibang siyudad ay umiiyak si Laura, kapag tinatahi ni Laura ang plumahe ni Florante ay parang korales ang kanyang mga daliri, takot si Laura na masugatan si Florante sa pakikipaglaban, ang baluti't koleto ay Hindi pinapayagan ni Laura na madampi't malapit sa katawan ni Florante hangga't Hindi niya nasisigurong wala na itong kalawang, pinahihiyasan ni Laura ang turbante ni Florante ng perlas, topasyo't maningning na rubi, kapag Hindi pa dumadating si Florante galing sa ibang siyudad o kahit saan ay Hindi mapalagay si Laura dahil akala ni Laura na nasugatan siya at kung may galos lang si Florante sa balat ay labis na ang pag-aalala ni Laura rito at Hindi naniniwala si Laura sa isang bagay kapag Hindi pa niya ito nasusuri.     Ang lahat ng iyan ay hinahanap ngayon ni Florante habang siya'y nakatali sa puno. Si Laura na lamang ang natitirang magpapaligaya kay Florante ngunit nasa ibang kandungan na ito at ang kanyang lungkot ay umalingawngaw sa buong gubat kaya sa kanyang matinding pagseselos at sakit na nararamdaman ay nahimatay siya.

Sino ang mga tahuan ng florante at Laura?,"Mga tauhan sa florante at laura at ang kanilang ginagampanan        Florante =>Si Florante ang pangunahing bida ng Florante at Laura, at halos lahat ng mga bahagi ng salaysay ay umiikot sa kanya. Anak ni Duke Briseo, siya ay ang mang-iibig ni Laurang Prinsesa ng Kaharian ng Albanyang namataan ni Florante bago siya sumabak sa isang digamaan nang ang bayan ng kanyang inang, si Prinsesa Floresca, Krotona ay sinakop ng mga Morong Persyano. Mula sa kagitnaan hanggang sa bandang katapuasan ng salaysay, siya ang nagsasalaysay. Ito ay isinasalaysay niya kay Aladin, ang Morong nagligtas sa kanya mula sa mga leon nang siya ay nakagapos pa dahil sa Konde Adolfo.   Konde Adolfo =>Sa Florante at Laura, si Konde Adolfo ang isa sa mga pangunahing kontrabida nito. Anak siya ng Konde Sileno, at pareho silang nagmula sa Albanya. Unang nagkita sina Konde Adolfo at Florante sa Atenas kung saan nag-aral sila pareho. Nangangagwat ang kanilang gulang nang dalawang taon, kung saan si Adolfo ang mas matanda. Noong kakarating pa lamang ni Florante sa Atenas, si Adolfo ang pinakasikat na mag-aaral doon. Ito ay buhat ng kanyang angking talino at ""kabaitan"". Ngunit habang tumatagal ang panahon, unti-unti ring napunta kay Florante ang kapurihan ni Adolfo. At dahil dito, pinagtangkaan pa nga niyang patayin si Florante sa isang dula-dulaan, na nagdulot ng pagkakita sa lahat ng kanyang pagbabalat-kayo, at pagpapaalis sa Atenas pabalik ng Albanya sa ilalim ng utos ng kanyang gurong si Antenor.   Aladin =>Si Aladin ay isang Morong Persyanong tumulong kay Florante, at nagligtas ng kanyang buhay. Ang kanyang ama ay si Sultan Ali-Adab na siya ring umagaw sa kanyang kasintahang si Flerida. Si Aladin at Florante ay nagkita nang hindi sinasadya, at karamihan ng mga bahagi ng awit ay isinasalaysay sa kanya ni Florante. Siya rin ang idolo ni Florante bilang pinakamagaling na mandirigma, ngunit sa kanilang pagkikita ay hindi alam ni Florante na ang kausap niya ay si Aladin, ang kanyang idolo. Sa katapusan ng awit, nang mamatay ang Sultan Ali-Adab ng Persya, siya na ang naging sultan.   Laura =>Si Laura ang minamahal nang lubos ni Florante. Anak ng Haring Linceo ng Albanya, siya ang prinsesa ng kahariang ito. Siya ay nagmamay-ari ng lubos na kagandahang ipinuring lubos ni Floranteng nadulot sa kanyang umibig kay Laura sa unang pagkakakita pa lamang. Sa simula ng awit, siya ay ikaluluksa ni Florante dahil sa kanyang pag-aakala na nililo Laura sa pagpapalit sa kanya kay Konde Adolfo.   Menandro =>Si Menandro ang matalik na kaibigan ni Florante sa Atenas na lumigtas din ng buhay ni Florante mula sa mga tagang nakakamatay ni Adolfong kanyang tinaga nang kanyang tangkaing patayin si Florante sa isang dula-dulaan nila sa kanilang paaralan sa Atenas. Bukod pa sa pagliligtas ng buhay niya, marami pa siyang ginawa para kay Florante, at noong sinakop ang Albanya nang makailang ulit, kasama siya ni Florante sa pakikibaka.   Flerida =>Si Flerida ang kasintahan ni Alading inagaw mula sa kanya ni Sultan Ali-Adab. At sa pagpapangakong pagpapakasal sa Sultan, napagpabago niya ang isip nito sa pagbitay kay Aladin. Ngunit sa katotohanan, hindi niya tinupad ang pag-aako, at tumakas sa araw ng kasal.   Duke Briseo =>Si Duke Briseo ang maarugaing ama ni Florante, at naglilingkod bilang sariling tanungan ng Haring Linceo ng Albanya. Siya ay pinatay at ipinaghagisan ang bangkay nito ng mga alagad ng Konde Adolfo nang kanyang agawin ang trono ng Haring Linceo.   Prinsesa Floresca=>Si Prinsesa Floresca ang ina ni Florante. Siya ay mula sa bayan ng Krotona, at maaagang namatay, na nagdulot sa pag-uwi ni Florante mula sa Atenas pabalik ng Albanya.       Antenor =>Si Antenor ay isang guro sa Atenas nina Florante, Konde Adolfo at Menandro.   Menalipo    =>Si Menalipo ay isang pinsan ni Florante. Iniligtas niya si Florante mula sa isang buwitreng dadagitin siya sana nang siyang isang sanggol pa lamang gamit ang kanyang pana at busog. Ipinapakita nito na si Menalipo ay higit na mas matanda kaysa kay Florante.    Konde Sileno =>Si Konde Sileno ang ama ni Konde Adolfong ayon kay Florante ay marangal.   Haring Linseo =>Si Haring Linseo ang hari ng Kaharian ng Albanya, at ama ni Laura. Ang kanyang pamumuno ay nagtapos nang mayroong kumalat na usap-usapan tungkol sa pag-uutos daw niyang harangin ang imbakan ng trigo upang gutumin ang mga tao ng Albanya. Ang usap-usapang itong pinasimulan ni Konde Adolfo ang nagpaalab ng mga damdamin ng mga tao sa Albanyang nagdulot sa pag-aaklas nila. Ang pag-aaklas namang ito ang ginamit ni Konde Adolfo upang maiupo ang sarili sa trono.   Sultan Ali-Adab =>Si Sultan Ali-Adab ang sultan ng Persyang umagaw sa kasintahan ni Alading si Flerida. Siya ay isang malupit na ama. Pinatawan niya ng kamatayan si Aladin, ang kanyang anak, dahil daw sa pagkatalo niya sa Persya, ngunit ang totoong dahilan dito ay upang makuha niya si Flerida mula sa kanyang anak. Ngunit hindi natuloy ang pagbitay kay Aladin, nang nangako si Flerida na kanyang pakakasalan ang Sultan, isang pangako na hindi rin natuloy nang tumakas si Flerida sa mismong araw ng kasal; ang naging hatol na lamang kay Aladin ay pagpapatalsik mula sa Persyang kailanman ay hindi niya mababalikan.   Osmalik =>Si Osmalic ang heneral ng hukbong Persyanong sumakop sa Krotona sa ilalim ng utos ni Aladin.   Miramolin =>Si Miramolin ang pinuno ng mga mananakop ng Albanya mula sa Turkiya.		"

Script ng buong kwento ng florante at laura?,"Tagapagsalaysay: Madilim, masukal, tahimik at mapanganib. Ito ang mga katangian ng isang gubat na mapanglaw at dito rin magsisimula ang kwento ng matamis na pag-iibigan nila Florante at Laura.  Sa gitna ng gubat, may isang lalaking nakatali sa puno na animo'y binugbog ng paulit-ulit at hinabol ang kanyang hininga. Ang pangalan niya'y Florante.  Habang nakatali sa puno, sinasabi niya ang kanyang mga nakaraan at isa na rito ang Albanya, isang kaharian kung saan siya'y isinilang na ngayo'y nanganganib.  Florante: O, aking Diyos Ama, nasan, nasan, ang iyong awa! Ako'y nananaghoy, nakikiusap, humihingi ng tulong niyo (bugtong hininga)  Patawarin niyo akong lahat dahil Hindi ko nagawang ipagtanggol ang ating kaharian laban sa taksil at walang awang si Adolfo. Tila yata wala nang nagmamahal sakin! Napakapait ng aking buhay! Inagaw niya ang korona ni Haring Linceo upang magawa niya ang kanyang ninanais. Pati si Duke Briseo na aking ama ay kanyang dinamay.  Tagapagsalaysay: Sandaling nanahimik si Florante dahil sa sama ng loob (umiyak sandali) matapos manahimik ay muli siyang tumawag sa Panginoon.  Florante: O aking Diyos Ama, tila yata di mo dinidinig ang aking mga panalangin sa'yo. Hindi ko tuloy maalis saking isipan na ayaw nyo na akong tulungan.  Kung gayon, papaano na ako, sinong aking malalapitan at makakapitan kung ang Diyos mismo ay ayaw na akong tulungan!  Paalam na Albanya, aking sinilangan, patawarin mo na lang ako dahil Hindi kita naipagtanggol.  Paalam na bayan ko, paalam rin sa'yo. Adolfong malupit, Laurang taksil! Paalam na sa inyo!  Tagapagsalaysay: Habang nagdudusa si Florante sa gubat, isang Gererong Morong nagngangalang Aladin ang dumating sa gubat na pagod na pagod at naghahanap ng pagpapahingahan.  Aladin: O, FleridaÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ¦ O tadhana, kay lupit mo, kinuha mo ang minamahal ko!  Tagapagsalaysay: Habang si Aladin ay umiiyak at nagdudusa ay may narinig siyang tinig sa kagubatan at pagkatapos ay may nakita siyang lalaki.  Aladin: O, ano yung tinig na aking naririnig? Tinig ng isang naghihinagpis na tao. Sino kaya siya?  Florante: Talagang ako'y minamalas. Ako'y pinapahirapan sa kamay nang taksil na si Adolfo. Si Adolfong malupit at higit pa sa halimaw kung manakit.  Aladin: Kaawa-awang tao, ang lahat ng kanyang tuwa'y natapos nang siya'y pinahirapan at pinagtaksilan.  Tagapagsalaysay: Pagkatapos na marinig ni Aladin si Florante ay nagmuni siya ng isang malaking problema.  Aladin: Tadhana'y masakit, problema ko'y napakahirap lutasin dahil sa aking sintang inagaw.  Tagapagsalaysay: Nagmamadali na si Aladin nang mapansing humina ang boses na kanyang narinigÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Aladin: Kailangan ko ng magmadali kundi, Hindi ko na maabutan ang taong iyonÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Tagapagsalaysay: Habang tumatakbo ay hinahawi niya ang mga sagabal sa pamamagitan ng kanyang kalis. Nang Makita niya ang nakagapos ay napansin niyang may nakapalibot ditong dalawang leon. Siya ay naghanda at nilusob ang mga leon. Pagkatapos niyang mapatay ang dalawang leon ay pinakawalan niya si Florante.  Aladin: Parang nakita ko na ang taong ito?  Tagapagsalaysay: Pagkalipas ng ilang oras ay namulat si Florante atÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ¦  Florante: Laura nasaan ka? Tulungan mo akong makaalis ditoÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Tagapagsalaysay: Hindi na sumagot si Aladin at baka sa kawalang pag-asa ay matuluyan na si FloranteÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Florante: Sino ka at bakit ako narito?  Aladin: Magpahinga ka na lang. Ako ang nagligtas sa iyo.  Florante: Hindi mo ba napapansin na tayo ay magkaaway?  Aladin: Marahil, pero ika'y nangangailangan ng tulong.  Florante: Siguro nga ay patay na ako kung Hindi ka dumating. Ngunit ang pagkamatay ang siyang tunay kong kaligayahan.  Aladin: Hangal! Hindi mo ba alam na dinadagdagan mo lang ang iyong pasakit?!  Tagapagsalaysay: Hindi nagpansinan ang dalawa ngunit isinama ni Aladin si Florante sa kanyang pagpapahingahan at doon sila nagpalipas ng gabi.  Pagdating ng umaga ay napansin ni Aladin na malakas na si Florante kaya ito'y kanyang niyakap.  Florante: Maraming salamat sa lahat ng tulong mo kaibigan!  Tagapagsalaysay: Inaliw ni Aladin si Florante ngunit napansin nitong malungkot pa rin siya.  Aladin: Ano ba ang iyong problema? Maaari ko bang malaman?  Florante: Sige. Sisimulan ko ang aking kwento simula ng ako'y ipinanganak.  Tagapagsalaysay: Ang dalawa ay naupo upang magkuwetuhan.  Florante: Pinanganak ako sa bayan ng Albanya kung saan si Duke Briseo, ang aking ama, ay naninirahan. Ang ina ko na si Prinsesa Floresca ay nakatira sa Krotona. Ako ay pinangalanan nilang Florante.  Noong sanggol pa lamang ako ay muntik na akong dagitin ng isang buwitre. (sinasalaysay habang inaarte ng batang Florante)  Prinsesa Floresca: Florante! Tulong!  Menalipo: Bakit po anong problema?  Florante: Nakita ng pinsan kong si Menalipo na ako ay dadagitin ng buwitre kaya Dali-Dali niya itong pinana at napatay. At noon namang naglalakad ako ay kinuha ng isang areon sa aking dibdib ang aking Cupidong Dyamante. Buti na lang at Hindi ako napahamak. (isinasalaysay habang inaarte ng batang Florante)  Nang ako'y naging siyam na taong gulang ay lagi akong nasa burol at dala ang aking pana't busog at ako'y naghahanap ng hayop upang tirahin ng aking pana. Kapag ako'y napagod ay nagpapahinga at naliligo ako sa batis kung saan masasayang nag-aawitan ang mga nayades habang tinutugtog nila ang kanilang lira. Ang kanilang tawana'y nakapagpapawala ng aking pagod. (sinasalaysay habang inaarte ng batang Florante)(nagkakantahan ang mga nayades)  Pagkalipas ng ilang taon ay pinag-aral ako ng aking ama ngunit ayaw pumayag ng aking ina dahil ako'y lilisan.  Prinsesa Floresca: Bakit kailangan pa niyang umalis?  Duke Briseo: Dahil mas maganda ang pagtuturo roon. Kung Hindi siya mag- aaral ano ang kanyang magiging kinabukasan.  Pronsesa Floresca: Sino ang mag-aaruga sa kanya roon?  Duke Briseo: Aalagaan siya ng kanyang mga guro't kaibigan doon.  Florante: Sa mga sinabi ng ama ko ay nakumbinse niya si ina upang ako'y lumisan.  Tagapagsalaysay: Sa pagdating ni Florante sa AtenasÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Antenor: Florante, maligayang pagdating! Ako nga pala si Antenor at ako ang magiging guro mo dito sa Atenas.  Florante: (malungkot na malungkot) Salamat po!  Antenor: O, bakit tila kay lungkot mo?  Florante: Ayaw ko po kasing umalis sa Albanya.  Antenor: Hayaan mo, lilipas din yan.  Tagapagsalaysay: Sa isang buwang pagtigil ni Florante sa Atenas ay kapansin-pansin na palagi siyang tulala at di makakain.  Isang araw habang naglalakad si Florante ay nakasabay niya si Adolfo, ang kanyang kababayan. Napansin niya ang pinong pagkilos nito.  Makaraan pa ang anim na taong pag-aaralÃ¢ÂÂ¦Ã¢ÂÂ¦  Antenor: Binabati kita Florante! May talento ka sa pilosopiya, astrolohiya at matematika.  Florante: Salamat po!  Tagapagsalaysay: Dito nagsimulang magalit si Adolfo dahil nasasapawan na siya ni Florante.  Isang hapon, tinipon ni Antenor ang mga estudyante.  Antenor: Magkakaroon ng pagsasadula ng trahedya ng dalawang Apo. Si Florante ang mangunguna bilang Polinise at si Adolfo bilang Etyokles.  Tagapagsalaysay: Nang magsimula na ang dula-dulaan. Nanlisik ang mata ni Adolfo kay Florante.  Adolfo: (Handa nang paslangin si Florante) Ikaw ang umagaw ng kapurian ko, dapat kang mamatay.  Menandro: (Sinaklolohan si Florante) Adolfo, itigil mo ang iyong kahibangan.  Tagapagsalaysay: Natapos ang pagdiriwang at di na nakita si Adolfo.

Ngunit ilang araw na lang at aalis ka na rin.  Florante: Oo nga. Halika Laura, pumasok na tayo at magsisimula na ang piging.  Tagapagsalaysay: Pagkatapos ng tatlong gabing pigingÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Haring Linceo: Magandang gabi sa iyo Florante. Dapat ka ng maghanda para bukas.  Florante: Maraming salamat po sa paalala.

Florante: Pangako, Laura.  Laura: Paalam.  Florante: Paalam sa inyong lahat. Mga kawal, tayo ng lahat!  Tagapagsalaysay: Pagdating nila Florante sa Krotona, nakita nila ang hukbo ni Heneral Osmalik.  Osmalik: Sugod!  Florante: Sugod!  *digmaan*  Natitirang kawal ni Osmalik: Nasan ang kalaban?! (makikita sila Florante, Menandro at isa pang kawal) IsaÃ¢ÂÂ¦ DalawaÃ¢ÂÂ¦ TatloÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Takbo!  Florante: Nanalo tayo!! Mabuhay ang Albanya!  Mga kawal: Mabuhay!!  Florante: Mga kawal, babalik tayo sa Albanya.  Tagapagsalaysay: Sa pagnalik nila sa Albanya ay may nakasalubong silang mga di-binyagan na may dalang isang babae.  Di-binyagan: Sino kayo at bakit kayo narito?  Florante: Kami'y mga taga-Albanya./ Pakawalan niyo ang babaeng iyan!  *labanan*  Florante: Binibini, mawalang-galang na pero ngayon lang kita nakita rito. Maari ko bang malaman ang iyong pangalan?  Laura: Ako ito, Florante. Si Laura.  Florante: Laura? Bakit ka nandito?  Laura: Gusto ko lang malaman ang iyong kalagayan. Florante: Salamat sa pag-aabala. Kamusta ka na? Sana'y naging mabuti ka. Laura: Mabuti naman ako, pero Florante, kailangan ko ng tulong mo. May bayang malapit dito na pinagtataguan ng mga morong dumakip sa aking ama. Iligtas mo siya. Paano kung may masamang mangyari sa kanya? Paano kung...  Florante: Shhhh. Ako na ang bahala. Ililigtas ko ang iyong ama sa abot ng aking makakaya.  Tagapagsalaysay: Makalipas ang ilang linggoÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Florante: Nanalo ulit tayo!!!  Haring Linceo: Salamat naman at dumating ka.  Florante: Ginawa ko lang po ang aking tungkulin.  Tagapagsalaysay: Matapos noon ay bumalik na ang lahat sa Albanya.  Haring Linceo: Florante, pasensya ka na ngunit ipapadala ulti kita sa Etolya para lumaban sa mga turko. Mag-ingat ka.  Florante: Pupunta po kami kaagad.  Tagapagsalaysay: Makalipas ang ilang araw ng paglalakbayÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Miramdin: Kapag nakita niyo na sila ay sugurin niyo kaagad.

Florante: Maraming salamat, maaari ka ng umalis.  Tagapagsalaysay: Pagkatapos basahin ni Florante ang liham, pinatawag niya si Menandro.  Florante: Menandro, babalik ako sa Albanya, pinapupunta ako ng hari. Ikaw muna ang mamahala dito.  Menandro: Ikararangal ko ito.  Tagapagsalaysay: Umuwi si Florante sa Albanya nang nag-iisa. Pagdating niya ay pinaligiran siya ng mga kawal.  Florante: Anong ibig sabihin nito?!  Kawal2: Sumama ka sa amin kung ayaw mong masaktan.  Tagapagsalaysay: Dinala si Florante sa palasyo at nakita si Adolfo.  Adolfo: Kamusta na Florante? Matagal na tayong Hindi nagkakausap. Kuwentuhan mo naman ako.  Florante: Walang hiya ka!! Anong ginawa mo kay Laura?!!  Adolfo: Huminahon ka. Maayos ang kalagayan niya ngunit ikinalulungkot ko.. Magpaalam na ang iyong amang si Duke Briseo.  Florante: Papatayin kita, papatayin kita!  Adolfo: Mga kawal, alisin niyo ang taong ito sa harapan koÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Tagapagsalaysay: At doon nagwakas ang pagsasalaysay ng buhay ni FloranteÃ¢ÂÂ¦    Florante: At ganoon nga ang nagyari. Aladin: Hayaan mong ako naman ang magsalaysay ng aking buhayÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Ang ngalan ko'y Aladin mula sa syudad ng Persya. Anak ng bantog na sultan Ali- Adab. Kaya ako nandito dahil ako ay pinagtaksilan ng sarili kong ama.  Tagapaagsalaysay: Sasmantala, sa kabilang bahagi ng kagubatanÃ¢ÂÂ¦.  Laura: Anong gagawin mo sakin?! Saan mo ko dadalhin?!  Adolfo: Sumama ka na lang!  Flerida: Itigil mo yan! (pinana ni Flerida si Adolfo at napatay)  Aladin: (maririnig sila Flerida at Laurang nag-uusap ngunit Hindi nila alam na sila pala ito) Huh?!... Nakarinig ka ba ng mga nag-uusap?  Florante: Oo, halika't hanapin natin kung saan ito nagmumula. (pinakinggan nila ito)  Flerida: Nang mabalitaan ko na pupugutan ng ulo ang aking minamahal, ako ay nagmakaawa sa hari na huwag na itong ituloy, matapos nito, ako ay nagdamit gerero upang makatakas sa kaharian.  Tagapagsalaysay: Di na nakatiis si Florante at AladinÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Kaagad nilang nilapitan ang kanilang sinisinta. Wari bang sabik sa pagmamahal ng isa't-isa.  Florante: O Laura aking mahal kay tagal nating Hindi nagkita!  Laura: Mahal ko!  Aladin: Flerida! Aking sinta!  Flerida: O AladinÃ¢ÂÂ¦  Florante: Pano ka napadpad dito, Laura?  Laura: Hayaan mong ikwento ko ang mga nangyari sakin sa bingit ng kamatayanÃ¢ÂÂ¦ (malungkot at iiyak) Nang ikaw ay mawala, naging magulo na ang bayan. Madalas akong pagtangkaan ni AdolfoÃ¢ÂÂ¦ Higit pa dito, pinaslang niya ang aking amang hari at maging ang iyong ama na si Duke Briseo. Flerida: Ako'y nahabag kay Laura ng makita kong nilalapastangan siya ni Adolfo kaya kinuha ko ang busog at palaso at pinana ko sa dibdib ang walag-awang hangal.  Florante: Sadyang kay lupit ng tadhana sa ating lahat. Ngunit ngayon ay masaya na tayong lahat at magkakasama.  Tagapagsalaysay: Habang sila ay nag-uusap ay dumating si Menandro at ang kanyang mga sundalo. Dapat ay hahanapin nila si Adolfo upang singilin sa kanyang mga kasalanan nang Makita nilang maayos na ang lahat.. Matapos ang sandaling pag-uusap ay bumalik ang lahat sa Albanya. Masaya ang mga tao na nakita silang maayos na nakabalik. Kaagad naman dinaos ang kasal Nina Florante at Laura at maging Nina Aladin at Flerida matapos sila kapwa magpabinyag.  Aladin: Florante, ako muna ay panandaliang magpapaalam sayo. May nagbalita kasi sa akin na sumakabilang buhay na ang aking ama. Kailangan ko siyang puntahan. Sa kabila ng mga kasalanan niya sakin, siya'y mananatiling ama ko pa rin. Ako ang papalit sa puwesto niya kaya't matatagalan bago tayo magkita muli. Ipinapangako namin na kami ay babalik dito upang kamustahin kayong mag-asawa. Paalam kaibigan!  Tagapagsalaysay: Dahil sa pagkamatay ni Haring Linceo at Duke Briseo ay pinalitan sila ni Florante. Sa kanyang, paghahari, nanumbalik ang dating katangian ng kaharian. Namauli ang kapayapaan, umunlad muli at bumalik rin sa dati ang mga tao. 		"
Buod ng bawat kabanata ng florante at laura?,"Kay Selya Ang araling ito ay nagsasalaysay at naglalarawan ng isang dalisay na pag-ibig. Ito'y tungkol sa unang pag-ibig ng may-akda na si Francisco ""Balagtas"" Baltazar kay Maria Asuncion Rivera na tinawag niyang Selya. Iniisip ng may-akda ang mga masasayang nangyari sa kanila ni Selya, gaya ng walang hanggang pagmamahalan nila sa isa't isa, ang larawan ni Selya na guhit sa sintang pinsel na ito raw ay inilimbag ng kanyang puso't panimdim na kahit kalian ay hindi mananakaw sa kanya at ang mga masasayang pangyayari sa ilog Beata. Nang matauhan siya sa kanyang pag-iisip napaiyak siya dahil sa labis na kalungkutan. Marami siyang tanong sa kanyang sarili na si Selya lamang ang makakasagot nito at naisip rin niya ang mga masasayang nimfas sa ilog ng Bai at ang mga sirena na ang mga tinig ay magaganda. Sinabi ni Francisco na kahit sumakabilang buhay na siya hinahangad parin niya na ang tapat na pag-ibig ay tumagal. Tinagurian niyang M.A.R. at tinawag na Selya ang kanyang unang pag-ibig.  _3_  Aralin 3  Puno ng Salita  Ang araling ito ay naglalarawan ng isang gubat at ng isang binatang lalaki na nakagapos sa isang puno. Inilarawan ang gubat bilang isang madilim dahil hindi makapasok ang sinag ng araw dahil sa mga malalaking puno gaya ng higera at sipres. Ang mga baging naman na namimilipit sa sanga ng kahoy ay puno ng tinik, may bulo ang mga bunga nito na nagbibigay-sakit kapag itoy kinain. Ang mga bulaklak sa nagtayong kahoy ay nakikiayon sa nakakahilong mabahong amoy ng gubat at karamihan sa mga hayop na gumagala rito ay syerpente at tigre na may masasamang loob. Ang gubat na ito ay malapit sa pinto ng Aberno Reyno na pinamumunuan ni Pluto na inilarawan bilang isang masungit at ang kanyang mga nasasakupang lupain ay dinidiligan niya ng tubig na galing sa ilog Kosito na makamandag ang tubig. Sa gitna ng malungkot na gubat ay may isang lalaking nakatali sa puno, inilarawan siya bilang isang binatang lalaki na maayos ang tindig kahit nakatali na ang kamay, paa't liig, makinis ang kanyang balat, at ang kanyang pilik-mata't kilay ay parang isang arko. Aralin 4  Kaliluha'y Hari  Ang araling ito ay naglalarawan ng kaguluhan na nangyari sa Albanya at kung ano ang naramdaman ni Florante sa mga pangyayaring ito. Sa gubat na kinalalagyan ni Florante ay walang nakatirang nimfas o harpyas na mahihingian niya ng tulong, kaya naman kinausap ni Florante ang Diyos sa pamamagitan ng padadasal. Ang kanyang mga hinaing ay tungkol sa mga taong masasama at mabubuti ang loob na nakatira sa Albanya at tungkol sa ibang bandila na iwinawagayway sa Albanya. Tinanong niya ang Diyos kung bakit ang mga masasamang tao ang nakakaranas ng tagumpay at ang mga mabubuting tao naman ang nakakaranas ng kamalasan. Sa galit ni Florante nasisi niya ang Diyos sa lahat ng mga nangyayari sa Albanya, kung bakit raw ito pinababayaang mangyari. Alam niya na ang nais ni Konde Adlofo ay ang korona ni Haring Linseo at sabugan ng sama ang Albanya. Kaya naman hiniling ni Florante mula sa makapangyarihang kamay ng Diyos na itapon ang kanyang galit sa mga taong may masasamang loob na nakatira sa Albanya at natanong rin niya kung bakit raw bingi ang kalangitan sa anyang mga sinasabi at kung bakit hindi siya makaranas ng tagumpay sa buhay.  _5_  Aralin 5  Ang Panibugo  Ang araling ito ay tungkol sa pagseselos ni Florante kay Konde Adolfo dahil nasa sinapupunan ni Konde Adolfo si Laura. Sinabi ni Florante sa Diyos na kung gusto niya talaga na siya'y magdusa may hihilingin lamang siyang isang bagay, at iyon ay ipaalala kay Laura na may Florante pang nagmamahal sa kanya na nasa gitna ng sakit at pagdurusa. Si Laura na lamang ang tanging taong natitira kay Florante ngunit sa kasamaang palad nasa ibang kandungan na ito. Nahimatay si Florante dahil sa sakit na kanyang nararamdaman, halos ang kanyang katawan ay puno ng sakit at pagdurusa at kung may makakita man sa kanyang kalagayan ay tiyak na maaawa ito. Ang gubat na madilim at malungkot ay nasasabugan ng libu-libong mga sakit at pagdurusa, na inuulit pa niyang sabihin at isinisigaw na bakit raw nagtaksil si Laura sa kanya na tapat naman ang kanyang hangarin at sumumpa raw si Laura sa harap ng langit na hindi magtataksil sa kanyang pag-ibig kaya ibinigay rin niya ang kanyang pag-ibig dahil wala sa isip niya na pagtataksilan siya ni Laura.  _6_  Aralin 6  Halina, Laura Ko  Ang araling ito ay tungkol sa pangungulila ni Florante kay Laura! Ang sabi ni Florante ay katiwala at kasintahan siya ni Laura, hindi raw niya akalain na sasayangin lamang ni Laura ang maraming luha na inalay nito para sa kanya at tinagurian pa siya nito ng ""giliw"" dahil si Florante ang lunas ng mga sakit na nararanasan ni Laura. Kapag umaalis o inuutusan si Florante ni Haring Linseo na pumunta sa ibang siyudad ay umiiyak si Laura, kapag tinatahi ni Laura ang plumahe ni Florante ay parang korales ang kanyang mga daliri, takot si Laura na masugatan si Florante sa pakikipaglaban, ang baluti't koleto ay hindi pinapayagan ni Laura na madampi't malapit sa katawan ni Florante hangga't hindi niya nasisigurong wala na itong kalawang, pinahihiyasan ni Laura ang turbante ni Florante ng perlas, topasyo't maningning na rubi, kapag hindi pa dumadating si Florante galing sa ibang siyudad o kahit saan ay hindi mapalagay si Laura dahil akala ni Laura na nasugatan siya at kung may galos lang si Florante sa balat ay labis na ang pag-aalala ni Laura rito at hindi naniniwala si Laura sa isang bagay kapag hindi pa niya ito nasusuri. Ang lahat ng iyan ay hinahanap ngayon ni Florante habang siya'y nakatali sa puno. Si Laura na lamang ang natitirang magpapaligaya kay Florante ngunit nasa ibang kandungan na ito at ang kanyang lungkot ay umalingawngaw sa buong gubat kaya sa kanyang matinding pagseselos at sakit na nararamdaman ay nahimatay siya.  _7_  Aralin 7  Ang Pagdating ni Aladin sa Guba t Ang araling ito ay naglalarawan ng isang lalaking gerero na pumunta sa gubat upang makalimutan ang masasakit na nangyari tungkol sa kanyang pag-ibig. Nang dumating ang isang gererong lalaki sa gubat na nakasuot ng putong na turbante na kahanga-hanga at ito ang pananamit ng mga Moro sa siyudad ng Persya. Huminto siya sa kanyang paglalakad at tumingin siya sa kanyang paligid upang humanap ng mapapahingahan at may nakita siyang isang bubong ng kahoy. Umupo siya sa puno ng isang kahoy at doon siya'y umiyak, ipinatong niya ang kanyang ulo sa kanyang kaliwang kamay at tinutop niya ang kanyang noo sa kanan. Tumagilid siya, nagwalang-bahala, tumigil siya sa kanyang pag-iyak at sinabi niya na ang tuwa na nararamdaman niya tungkol kay Flerida ay wala na dahil inagaw na ito ng kanyang ama. Ang sabi pa niya kung hindi raw ang kanyang ama ang umagaw kay Flerida malamang nakikipaglaban na siya ngayon upang ipaglaban ang kanyang mahal ngunit sa di sinasadyang pagkakataon ang ama niya ang umagaw kaya dapat niya itong igalang at inihambing pa siya kay Marte. Sinabi rin niya na talagang makapangyarihan ang pag-ibig dahil kahit anong panganib ang makakaharap, ito'y hahamakin para lamang sa minamahal.  _8_  Aralin 8  Duke Briseo: Amang Mapagmahal  Ang araling ito ay nagsasalaysay kung paano walang awang pinatay ang ama ni Florante at narinig ito ng gerero habang isinasalaysay niya ito. Nang makarinig ang gerero ng iyak ni Florante, siya'y namangha kaya naman sinundan niya kung saan nanggagaling ang boses ng nagsasalita at dumating siya sa pinanggagalingan ng boses at narinig niya si Florante na umiiyak dahil sa pagkamatay ng kanyang ama. Pira-pirasong pinatay ang kanyang ama ni Konde Adolfo. Ang sabi pa ni Florante ang mga kaibigan ng kanyang ama ay nahati sa dalawang parte, may kumampi sa masama at may kumampi sa mabuti ngunit walang magawa ang mga kaibigan niyang hindi bumaliktad sa kanya dahil mapaparusahan lamang sila kapag lumapit sa pira-pirasong katawan ng kanyang ama at hindi man lamang siya nabigyan ng maayos na libing at sabi pa ni Florante na ninanais pa ng kanyang ama na matabunan siya ng bangkay sa gitna ng pagpapatayan at ng hindi mahulog sa kamay ni Konde Adolfo na higit pa sa halimaw ang ugali. Para kay Florante, si Duke Briseo ay isang ulirang ama dahil kahit sa huling sandali ng buhay nito ang kapakanan parin ng kanyang anak ang iniisip at sinabi na Florante na nung mamatay ang kanyang ama ang lahat ng tuwa na kanyang nararamdaman ay nawala sa kanya.  _9_  Aralin 9  Ang Morong Nakikinig  Ang araling ito ay tungkol sa isang gererong naghahanap ng tunay na kalinga at pagmamahal ng isang ama. Nang mapakinggan ni Aladin ang mga daing ni Florante ay agad niyang naisip ang kanyang ama at hindi niya napigilang umiyak. Parang ikinukumpara ni Aladin ang kanyang ama sa ama ni Florante kung paano ito mag aruga ng isang anak. Ang ama ni Aladin ay kilala niya bilang isang sakim at makasariling ama. Inagaw nito ang kanyang kasintahan at nais ng kanyang ama na lumubog siya sa dusa at siya'y mamatay. Namatay ang kanyang ina ng siya'y isinilang kaya naman ang kanyang ama nalang ang nagpalaki sa kanya, ngunit ang pagpapalaki nitoay pawing dusa at sakit ang kanyang nararamdaman.  _10_  Aralin 10  O, Laura  Nang matauhan si Aladin sa kanyang pag-iisip sa kanyang ama, narinig niya ang muling pananambitan ni Florante at ito'y tungkol kay Laura. Nagpapaalam siya at sinabi niyang kahit siya'y sumakabilang buhay na mamahalin niya parin si Laura. Hindi pa natapos ni Florante ang pangungusap na ito ay may dalawang leon ng papunta sa kanya at ng nasa harapan na niya ito, ito'y tumigil at mukhang naawa sa kanyang kalagayan. Nagpaalam si Florante sa Albanyang pinaglingkuran niya na ngayon ay pinamamayanan na ng kasamaan, lupit, bangis at kaliluhan. Bata pa lamang si Florante nais na niyang paglingkuran ang bayan ng Albanya. Sa kabila ng lahat ng ito nagpapasalamat parin si Florante dahil sa Albanya niya nakilala ang kanyang magiging kasintahan ngunit sa di inaasahan si Laura ay nagtaksil sa kanya.Nasa harapan na ni Florante ang papatay sa kanya at mamamatay raw siya na hindi kapiling si Laura at iyon ang pinakamasakit na pangyayari sa kanyang buhay. Umiyak si Florante dahil hindi na niya nakayanan ang sakit na kanyang nararamdaman, narinig ng gerero ang lahat ng pananambitan ni Florante na nakakatakot kaya naman tinunton ni Aladin kung nasaan nanggagaling ang boses na kanyang naririnig. Nang malapit na si Aladin kung saan nandoon si Florante ay nakita niya ang matibay na pagkakatali nito sa puno at bigla siyang umiyak dahil sa awa. Nais ng silain ng mga leon si Florante ngunit naabutan ito ni Aladin at inusig niya ng taga ang dalawang mababangis na leon at namatay ito.  _11_  Aralin 11  Ang Pakikipaglaban ni Aladin sa Dalawang Leon  Nang magtagumpay si Aladin sa pagpatay sa dalawang leon , kinalagan niya kaagad si Florante at siya'y umiiyak habang kinakalagan niya ito. Nakita ni Aladin ang dugo na nunukal sa gitgit dahil sa pagkakatali nito sa puno. Ang ginawa ni Aladin ay inalalyan niya si Florante upang maiupo at kinalong niya ito. Sa pagtitig ni Aladin kay Florante habang ito'y natutulog, si Florante ay biglang gumising at hinahanap si Laura at bumalik ito sa pagkakatulog. Natakot si Aladin na sagutin si Florante kaya pinabayaan niya na lamang ito. Nang muling gumising si Florante nakita niya ang isang lalaki na nakadamit pang Moro at siya'y nabigla, nais sana niyang ilayo ang kanyang katawan kay Aladin ngunit hindi niya ito nagawa dahil mahina pa siya. Sinabi niya kay Florante na ang baya't sekta nila ay magkaaway ngunit sa pangyayaring ito ay dapat silang maging magkaibigan at sinabi rin niya na siya ay tao lamang na sumusunod rin s autos o batas ng langit kaya naman tinulungan niya si Florante. Nagbuntung-hininga si Florante at sinisi niya si Aladin kung bakit siya nito kinalag sa puno hindi sana ngayon ay payapa na ang kanyang buhay sa loob ng tiyan ng leon dahil mas hinahangad pa ni Florante na mamatay na lamang siya kaya. Hindi napigilan ni Aladin ang umiyak sa mga pinagsasabi ni Florante. _12_ Aralin 12  Ang Pag-aaruga ni Aladin kay Florante  Ang araling ito ay nagsasalaysay kung paano inalagaan ni Aladin si Florante hanggang sa ito'y gumaling at ikinuwento ni Florante ang kanyang pagkabata. Nang mapansin ni Aladin na gumagabi na sa gubat humanap siya ng lugar upang doon alagaan si Florante at sa unang hinintuan niyang dako ay may nakita siyang isang malapad at makinis na bato at doon niya hiniga si Florante. Kumuha siya ng kanyang kunting baon upang kumain at inalok niya si Florante nito, sa una ito'y umayaw ngunit hindi naglaon ito'y tinanggap rin. Naluwag-luwagan ang kanilang paghihinagpis at nabawasan ang pagkagutom. Nakatulog si Florante sa sinapupunan ni Aladin at hindi natulog si Aladin dahil siya'y natatakot na baka makagat si Florante ng mga masasamang hayop na gumagala sa gubat at kapag nagigising si Florante parang natatakot si Aladin baka may masama ng nangyari rito. Nang magmamadaling-araw ay nahimbing at munting napayapa sa dalang mga problema hanggang nagumaga ay walang binitawang hinagpis at daing si Florante. Lumakas na muli ang katawan ni Florante at dahil sa tuwa ni Aladin ay napayakap siya kay Florante. Tinanong ni Aladin si Florante tungkol sa buhay niya at sinabi ni Florante na ang buhay niya ay puno ng dusa at sakit! Sinabi niya kay Aladin na sana sa Krotona na lamang siya lumaki at hindi nalang sa Albanya, ang ama raw niyang si Duke Briseo ay ang tanungan ni Haring Linseo sa anumang bagay at ito ang pangalawang puno sa sangkaharian, mabait ang kanyang ama at sa katapangan ay siya ang pang-ulo sa siyudad ng Albanya. Ang sabi ni Florante walang mahahalagang nangyari sa kanyang buhay ng siya'y musmos pa lamang, sabi ng kanyang ina ng siya raw ay natutulog sa bahay nila na malapit sa bundok pumasok ang isang ibong pang-amoy ay abot hanggang tatlong legwas sa patay na hayop, mabuti nalang at dumating ang pinsan ng kanyang ina na si Menalipo at pinana niya ang ibon at ito'y namatay. Nang si Florante ay naglalaro sa salas may isang alko na kinuha ang kupidong diyamante sa dibdib niya at ng tumuntong siya sa siyam na taon, parati siyang naglalaro sa burol dahil parati siyang namamana ng ibon. Sa tuwing umaga bago lumalabas ang masayang sinag ng araw ang kanyang libangan ay sa tabi ng gubat a hanggang sa tingal-in ng ang sinag ng araw na hindi matitigan ay sinasagap niya ang kaligayahang handog ng hindi maramot na parang. Aralin 13  Kabataan ni Florante  Ang araling ito ay tungkol sa mga bagay na ginagawa ni Florante ng siya'y bata pa lamang. Nakatira si Florante sa Krotona na isang malayang bata na nagagawa kung ano ang gusto niyang gawin, gaya ng, mamana ng mga ibon o pumatay ng mga hayop. Ang sabi niya kay Aladin kapag may nakita raw siyang hayop na tinitingala niyang malapit sa bundok, bigla raw niyang ibibinit ang pana sa busog sa minsang tudla niya ay pilit na matutuhog at kapag napatay na niya ay mag-uunahang makarampot ang kanyang mga kasama at kapag nakakapatay raw siya ay halos hindi masukat ang kanyang kaligayahan. Natutunan niya sa kanyang ama na hindi nararapat palakihin ang isang bata na laki sa layaw at puro kaligayahan ang natatamasa dahil kapag dumating ang panahon na darating sa kanyang buhay ang kasawian at kalungkutan ay hindi niya ito malulutas dahil siya'y nasanay sa kaligayahan. Sa lagay na ito ipinadala siya ng kanyang ama sa Atenas at ito ang dahilan ng pag-iyak ng kanyang ina. Sa Atenas ang nagging maestro niya ay si Antenor, lahi ng mga Pitako, ito'y mabait at marunong na isang maestro.  _14_  Aralin 14  Nahubdan ng Balatkayo  Isang buwan na hindi kumain si Florante at parating umiiyak simula ng siya'y ipinadala ng kanyang ama sa Atenas at hindi nagtagal napayapa siya dahil sa pag-aliw ng kanyang maestrong si Antenor. May nadatnan siyang isang batang madlang nag-aaral at iyon ay si Adolfo ang anak ng isang marangal na si Konde Sileno. Labing dalawang taon na si Adolfo't si Florante naman ay labing isa pa lamang. Kilala si Adolfo bilang isang mahinhin ang kanyang ugali ay hindi magaslaw, kung lumakad ito'y laging patungo at mabinining mangusap at walang katalo, lapastanganin man siya ay hindi siya nabubuyo. Siya ang huwaran ng kanyang mga kaklase sa kabaitan. Sinabi rin ni Florante na ang katalasan ng kanyang maestrong si Antenor ay hindi mabatid ang lalim na lihim ni Adolfo at sinabi rin ni Florante na ang sabi ng kanyang ama na ang bait na hindi paimbabaw ito'y namumunga ng kaligayahan. Sa madaling salita mabigat ang loob ni lorante kay Adolfo at alam niyang ganoon din ang nararamdaman ni Adolfo sa kanya. Isang araw natarok ang kaalaman ni Florante ang lalim ng pilosopiya, natutunanrin niya ang astrolohiya at ang matimatika. Ang pagkatuto raw niya ay parang isang himala si Adolfo raw ay naiwan sa gitna at ang maingay na tagapamalita sa buong Atenas ay gumagala-gala. Siya na ang usap-usapan mapabata man o mapatanda ay nakatalastas ng pangalan ni Florante. Nahalata si Adolfo na nagbabalatkayo lamang ng dumating ang araw ng pagkakatuwaan ng mga mag-aaral na nagbibinata, iba't iang laro ang kanilang nisipan at sinukat nila ang galling sa sayawan na naaayon sa musika't awit na mapakikinggan. May laro ring buno't arnis na kinaitaan ito ng kanilang liksi't karunungan.  _15_  Aralin 15  Nasalag ang Dagok  Ang araling ito ay tungkol sa ipinalabas na trahedya nina Florante. Si Florante ay gaganap bilang si Etyokles ang magiging kapatid ni Polinese at anak nina Edipo at Yokasta at si Adolfo naman ay gaganap bilang si Polinese ang anak nina Edipo at Yokasta at kapatid ni Etyokles. Nang isinasadula na nila ang kwento, iba ang mga pinagsasabi ni Adolfo sa kanya ay wala ito sa orihinal. Sinabihan siya ni Adolfo na inagaw raw niya ang kapurihan na dapat ay nasa kanya at sinabi rin niya na dapat lng mamatay si Florante kaya inilabas ni Adolfo ang knyang dalang patalim at balak saksakin si Florante, sa kanyang kakailag iya'y natumba buti nalang t nailigts siya ni Menandro, ang kanyang kaibigan. Pagkatapos ng pangyayaring ito hindi na nila nakita si Adolfo. Naging Isang taon pa ang pamamalagi niya sa Atenas at pinadalhan siya ng sulat ng kanyang ama upang ipaalam na namatay ang kanyang ina. Labis ang sakit na naramdaman ni Florante, dalawang oras siyang nawalan ng malay ng mabasa niya ang liham na ipinadala ng kanyang ama. Nang siya'y magkamalay naisip niya agad ang sakit at ang kanyang dalawang mata'y hindi mapigil sa pag-iyak at sabi pa niya na noong malaman niya na namatay ang kanyang ina ay pakiramdam niya pasan niya ang buong sandaigdigan at nag-iisa lamang siya sa gitna ng lumbay kaya naman ang ginawa ng kanyang maestroy inaliw siya nito.  _16_  Aralin 16  Ang mga Habilin ni Antenor kay Florante  Ang araling ito ay tungkol sa mga habilin ni Anteno kay Florante papunta sa Albanya. Dalawang buwang hindi nakatikim ng ligaya't aliw si Florante sa Atenas simula ng malaman niyang namatay ang kanyang ina. Dumating ang ikalawang sulat ng kanyang ama at ng sabi rito ay pauuwiin na siya sa Albanya at nagpaalam siya sa kanyang maestrong si Antenor. May hinabilin sa kanya si Antenor bago siya umalis. Dapat raw siyang mag-ingat sa handa na patibong ni Adolfo at kung ang isalubong raw kay florante ay masayang mukha , mas lalo raw siyang mag-ingat at wag magpapahalata na alam ang nasa ni Adolfo upang makapaghanda siya sa araw ng digma. Hindi niya napigilan ang umiyak ay niyakap siya nito ng mahigpit at ang huling tagubilin ng kayang maestro sa kanya ay dapat raw niyang tiisin ang mga problemang naghihintay sa kanyang pagdating sa Albanya. Naghiwalay sila ng kaniyang mga kaklase at si Menandro ay labis ang pagdaralita kaya naman ng magyakapann ang dalawang magkaibigan ay hindi na nila binitawan ang isa't isa kaya tinulutan na lamang ni Antenor na sumama si Menandro kay Florante patungo sa Albanya at silay umalis na. Nang makaraling na sila sa Albanya sinalubong siya ng kanyang ama at nagbatian silang dalawa, nadagdagan ang sakit na naramdaman ni Florante dahil sa kalagayan ng kanyang ama.  _17_  Aralin 17  Ang Heneral ng Hukbo  Nagpadala ng sulat ang lolo ni Florante na ang Krotona ay kinubkob ng mga Moro na pinamumunuan ni Heneral Osmalik ng Persya, ayon sa balita ay pangalawa ito ng prinsipeng kilala sa buong mundo. Si Aladin na hinahangaang kababayan ni Florante. Napangiti si Aladin at sinabi niya na bihira lang raw ang totoong pagbaybay ng balita at kung magkatotoo raw ito ay marami ang dagdag, madalas raw kilala ang isang tao na matapang kung ang kalaban ay takot sa kanya at sinabi rin ni Aladin na katulad lang sila ng nararamdaman ni Florante ng sakit tungkol sa kanilang pag-ibig. Singot siya ni Florante na hindi nararapat matulad ang isnag gerero sa tulad niyang api at sa kaaway may hindi niya raw ito ninanais sa laki raw ng dusa na kanyang natatamasa. Humarap si Duke Briseo kay Haring Linseo upang ipakilala ang kanyang anak na si Florante at ng makilala niya ito namangha ang hari at niyakap niya si Florante. Ginawa siyang heneral sa isang hukbo na dadalo sa bayan ng Krotona na sinakop ng mga Moro. Kahit labag sa kalooban ng kanyang ama ay pumayag na lamang ito at siya'y walang sagot na naisabi kundi yakapin na lamang ang kanyang magiging kapalaran sa bayan ng Albanya.  _18_  Aralin 18  Patay o Himala  Isinalaysay ni Florante kay Aladin kung paano sila nagkakilala ni Laura. Nagkakilala sila ni Laura ng siya'y inimbitahan ni Haring Linseo sa palasyo tungkol sa hukbo na kanyang pamumunuan. Nakilala niya ang isang napakagandang dilag roon at nagkwentuhan sila sa kanilang mga buhay. Sinabi ni Florante na kung hindi siya inimbitahan ni Haring Linseo na pumunta sa palasyo hindi niya makikilala si Laura at hindi siya masasaktan. Hindi niya akalain na pagtataksilan siya ni Laura at naisip niya na kung gaano ka kataas ang pagkadakila ito rin ang paglagapak kung mararapa, sinabi rin niya na inagaw raw ni Aladin ang isang gawain na nararapat ang ina niya ang gumawa ngunit sa kadahilanang sawi siya sa lahat ng bagay. Namatay ang kanyang ina na sa kaunting panahon lamang niya ito nakapiling at pinagtaksilan siya ng kanyang pinakamamahal na babaeng si Laura. Tatlong araw na pinigingan ng hari ng palasyo real si Florante.  _19_  Aralin 19  Perlas sa Mata'y Nunukal  Sa araling ito natikman ni Florante ang lalong dalamhati at ito'y higit pa raw sa naunang dalitang tiniis at pinasinungalingan niya ng lahat ng sakit dahilan lamang sa pag-ibig. Kinabukasan bago umalis ang hukbo ni Florante papuntang Krotona nakausap niya si Laura at sinabihan niya ito ng mga matatamis na salita nag buntong-hininga, luha at himutok ang matinding naramdaman ni Florante. Kahit hindi siya sinagot ni Laura ng matamis na oo may mababaon parin siya sa kanyang pakikipaglaban ang hiyang perlas na sa mata'y tumulo. Dumating na ang araw ng pag-alis ni Florante papuntang Krotona at maraming tanong ang nais ni Florante na masagot bago siya umalis tungkol kay Laura. Dumating na ang hukbo ni Florante sa bayan ng Krotona at doon naglaban ang dalawang kampo at ito'y umabot ng limang oras hanggang sa mapagod si Heneral Osmalik at ng mapatay ni Florante si Heneral Osmalik ay parang nagluksa ang langit.  _20_  Aralin 20  Krotona'y Nagdiwang  Nang matalo ni Florante si Heneral Osmalik pumunta sila sa palsyo real at doon sinalubong sila ng kanyang lolo at mga mamamayan ng Krotona. Malaki ang pasasalamat ng mga mamamayan kay Florante dahil ang bayan raw nila ngayon ay muling nabuksan at ballot na balot ito ng kaligayahan. Nagsiakyat sila Florante sa palasyo real upang magpahinga. Tatlong araw na hindi natulog ang mga tao sa Krotona dahil sa kanilang hindi mapantayang ligaya. Sa ligaya raw nila ng kanyang nunong hari nakipagitan roon ang pagkamatay ng kanyang ina ay naungkat muli, kaya dn naniwala ang batang loob ni Florante na sa mundo'y walang lubos na katuwaan dahil sa minsang ligayang nararamdaman may mga problema parin ang mapagdadaanan. Limang buwang nanatili si Florante sa Krotona at nagpilit bumalik sa Albanya. Sa kanilang paglalakad parang hindi siya mapalagay, parang nais na niyang makarating agad sa Albanya.  _21_  Aralin 20  O, Sintang Florante  Nang dumating ang hukbo ni Florante sa bayan ng Albanya, nakita nila ang pulutong ng mga Moro. May nakita siyang isang binibini na nasa kamay ng mga Moro at ito'y nakagapos at pakiramdam nila ito'y pupugutan ng ulo. Ang puso ni Florante ay lalung naipit ng lumbay dahil nangangamba siya na ito'y si Laura. Hindi niya napigilan ang kanyang galit na nararamdaman at agad nilang nilusob ang mga Moro ang ibang Moro ay tumakbo kaya ng wala na siyang mapagbubuntungang galit inalis niya ang takip sa mukha ng isang binibini at tama nga ang kanyang hinala na ito'y si Laura. Kaya raw ito pupugutan ng ulo dahil hindi tinanggap ni Laura ang pag-ibig na alay ni Emir, kaya ng magtangkang gahasain ni Emir si Laura ay sinampal niya ito. Kinalag niya ang gapos na lubid sa kamay ni Laura at nahihiya pa siyang madampian ang magandang balat nito. Dito nakatanggap ng lunas ng pag-ibig si Florante ng titigan siya ni Laura at banggitin ang kanyang pangalan. Nang malaman niyang ang Haring Linseo at ang kanyang ama ay nasa kulungan agad siyang pumunta sa bilangguan ng reyno at nakita niya roon si Haring Linseo, ang kanyang ama at si Adolfo. Hindi masukat ang kaligayahan ng Hari at ng kanyang ama sa kanyang natamong tagumpay habang si Adolfo naman ay nagdadalamhati sa tagumpay na nakamit ni Florante. Ang pangimbulo ni Adolfo kay Florante ay lalung lumala ng tawagin si Floranteng tagapagligtas ng siyudad ng Krotona at ipinagdiwang pa ito ng matataas na hari sa palasyo real.  _22_  Aralin 21  Silu-Silong Sakit  Hindi dumating ng ilang buwan ang kasiyahan na natatamasa ng Albanya dahil may isang dumating na isang hukbong maninira na taga-Turkiya. Ang panganib at pag-iiyakan ay bumalik sa bayan ng Albanya lalung-lalo na kay Laura na natatakot na baka mapahamak si Florante. Sa kadahilanang inutusan siya ni Haring Linseo at siya ang napiling maging pinuno ng hukbo, hindi niya ito dapat suwayin. Natalo ni Florante ang hukbo ni Miramolin sa Etolya at nakatanggap ng sulat si Aldin na galling sa kanyang ama na siya'y pinapabalik kaagad sa ALbanya. Gabi na ng dumating si Florante sa Albanya at pumasok kaagad siya sa Reyno at nahulog siya sa patibong na inihanda ni Adolfo. Nalaman rin ni Florante na pinatay ni Adolfo si haring Linseo at ang kanyang ama at ang pinakamasakit pa nito ay ikakasal na si Laura kay Adolfo. Sa pagkabilanggo niya ng labingwalong araw naiinip si Florante sa kanyang kamatayan at gabi na noong dinala siya sa gubat at iginapos siya sa isang napakalaking puno upang doon ay makagat ng mga gumagalang hayop. _23_ Aralin 22  Kawawang Aladin  Pagkatapos magsalaysay ni Florante, si Aladin naman ang nagkuwento tungkol sa kanyang buhay. Sinabi niyang ang kanyang sariling ama ang nakaagaw niya sa pag-ibig kay Flerida. Binalak siyang papugutan ng ulo ng kanyang ama dahil sa pag-iwan sa hukbo habang nakikipagdigma sa Albanya. Pumayag si Flerida na pakasal kay Sultan Ali-Adab upang hindi mapatay si Aladin kung kaya't pinaalis na lamang siya ng kaharian at hindi na maaaring bumalik sa Persya.  _24_  Aralin 23  Hatinggabing Kadiliman  Habang nag-uusap sina Florante at Aladin ay may narinig silang dalawang babaing nag-uusap. Nakita nilang sina Laura at Flerida pala ang naririnig nilang nag-uusap. Nalaman nilang si Flerida ay tumakas sa pamamagitan ng pagsusuot ng damit gerero dahil hindi niya maatim na pakasalan ang ama ng kanyang tunay na iniibig. Samantalang si Laura naman ay hindi tinanggap ang alok na pagmamahal ni Adolfo kaya't dinala siya nito sa gubat upang pagsamantalahan subalit dumating si Flerida at siya'y iniligtas. Naging maligaya ang apat lalo na si Florante dahil napag-alaman nitong hindi nagtaksil sa kanya si Laura. Lalo silang natuwa nang dumating si Menandro at ibinalita na nabawi na nila ang Albanya.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Umuwi ang apat sa Albanya na maligayang-maligaya. Nagpabinyag sina Aladin at Flerida sa Kristiyanismo at nagpakasal. Maging sina Florante at laura ay pinag-isang dibdib at sila'y naging hari at reyna ng Albanya. Muling nagbalik sina Aladin at Flerida sa Persya at namuno sa kanilang kaharian. . 		"

Is there a new planet named planet x?,"Short answer:  no .   Here's the long version.  ""Planet X"" was the hypothetical name given to an as-yet-undiscovered planet about a hundred years ago. The planet Neptune was discovered because mathematicians analyzing the orbit of the planet Uranus found that its orbit didn't quite match theory. This was kind of upsetting, because the theory was working so well for all the other planets, so they decided that there must be another planet out there past Uranus, and a couple of them did all the calculations required to tell astronomers where to look for this additional planet, and a couple of astronomers did exactly that, and lo and behold they found Neptune.  So, a bit after that, they did the same kind of analysis of Neptune's orbit, and said ""Hey, there's another one, we'll call it Planet X as a placeholder."" Figuring out where Planet X needed to be turned out to be more complicated, and it took a couple of decades before Clyde Tombaugh noticed a tiny point of light that moved (very slowly) and dubbed it Pluto.  Now comes the problem. Pluto was way too dim. To account for the discrepancies in Neptune's orbit, Planet X/Pluto needed to be fairly massive, which meant fairly  big , and Pluto was just too dim to be as big as it needed to be, unless it was really, really dark (a lot darker than the Moon, which, despite how bright it looks in the sky, is actually about the color of old asphalt). So maybe there was Pluto, and another Planet X out beyond that...  Except there wasn't. There wasn't anything out there large enough to be Planet X. And the more we learned about Pluto, the smaller it seemed to get. When I was a child in the 1960s, it was thought that Pluto might be as large as Earth. Then it was revised downward to maybe about the size of Mars in the 1970s, then maybe as big as Mercury, and we now know it's considerably smaller than the Moon and not actually a ""planet"" by the modern definition.  So what explains the discrepancies in Neptune's orbit, then? It turns out that later, more careful observations showed that Neptune is moving precisely as it should be, and there's no need to invoke any mysterious Planet X to explain its orbit.  So, not only is there not a planet named Planet X, there never really was one, and it's now considered unlikely that there could be (because if there was, it would show up by affecting Neptune's orbit in predictable ways, and we've measured Neptune's orbit accurately enough to pretty much rule that out).  One other time the term ""Planet X"" has been used is in explaining the orbit of Mercury. Mercury's orbit precesses (wobbles, if you like) around the Sun, and the reason is that it's affected by the other planets. However, after taking them all into account, it wasn't quite enough to explain Mercury's precession, so there was some talk of a ""Planet X"" inside the orbit of Mercury (though a more common name for this hypothetical planet was ""Vulcan""). Relativity shot that one down; when you take relativistic effects into account, it explains Mercury's orbit extremely well.  Finally, ""Nabiru"". Nabiru is a term that appears in some ancient mesopotamian texts. It's pretty vague, and no one's quite sure what it means. One thing it definitely does  not  mean is some mysterious planet that's coming to smash into the world or anything like that. It's likely that it's either an alternative name referring to one of the known planets (probably Jupiter), or it might be a word to describe a conjunction of a planet and a star, or two (or more) planets ... the ancients were pretty loose with what they called ""stars"". Planets? Wandering stars. Comets? Hairy stars. (The words ""planet"" and ""comet"" literally come from the Greek words for ""wander"" and ""hair"" respectively.) 		"

During many millions of years, the Solar system was very muchlike a cosmic billiard table: every recently formed body collided -with moderate to extreme violence - with other bodies.   . 
A great number of planets and planetesimals (many astronomersbelive our stellar system had, in the first stages of formation,several hundereds of planetary bodies), were totally destroyed andformed what it would became much later the  AsteroidBelt  and/or the  Kuiper Belt .   Other bodies collided and formed other different planets (the caseof the primordial Earth and a Mars-sized planet collision creatingthe binary system Earth/Moon).   . 
There were  MIGRATIONS  of planets (including jovian  planets) from the Sun's neighbour to outersolar system, and vice-versa, causing bizarre anomalies in allplanet's orbits.  Some planets were simply gravitationally thrown out to the Kuiper Belt  (such as the trans-Neptunian  objects like Sedna  and  Eris ), eventually toextremely eccentric orbits in the  Oort Cloud  oreven expelled for ever from the solar system, becamingÂ« rogue planets Â».

How can change gas to solid?,"Changing a gas to a solid is dependent on one crucial thing; the material in question! For example, with steel that is in a gaseous state, which requires a substantial and extreme amount of heat {around 3000 Kelvin in the most heat-tolerant ores), needs only a cooling agent to turn directly from gas to solid. This process is primarily done with liquid iron, rather than vaporeal iron, but the idea still is relevant. That process is what allows us to produce ball bearings and mold things.    There is of course the second method, which is how ""liquid"" propane stays a ""liquid"", even though it boils quite well below the freezing point of water. That method is pressurization. A very large volume of gas is placed into a reinforced container. This container squeezes that great volume into such a small area, the gas acts like a solid; clumping together, even though under normal pressure, it would be floating into neverland. This method works for organic gases and fluids; like butane lighters and propane grills, that boil below temperatures humans are comfortable in. 		"
What is it called when solids change to gas?,A phase change from solid directly to gas is called sublimation. A common example of sublimation is that of dry ice (solid carbon dioxide).

What is changes in solid liquid and gas?,"The change between solid, liquid and gas is known as a change of state and is affected by the substance and its temperature.  E.g. at room temperature water is liquid but a 0 o c it becomes ice, a solid. 		"
Why does mass not change when solid is melted?,"Mass is the amount of 'stuff' that a thing has, so assuming thatwhen you melt a solid part of it isn't vaporised, then the amountof stuff remains the same, even if it's changed it's form.  Mass is measured by weighing a thing within a gravitational field(with no other forces acting on it), not volume or shape. 		"

What are the challenges when teaching science in preschool?,"Challenges in school period. For one thing there is a lack of knowledge. Teachers especially in elementary schools do not have the direct training required for higher levels of science education. Many teachers do not feel comfortable teaching science and are very unsure of how to go about teaching science even though many schools are adopting programs that come with all the guided material necessary to provide students with hands on concrete experiences. Another probelm is the stress of the No Child Left behind act. This act and the mandates thereof leave both administrators and teachers alike stressed to make sure that all the required material that will be presented on the standardized test will be covered. If the school does not make AYP (average yearly progress) funding will be cut and over a period of time if the school continues not to make AYP a revamping process for that school will occur and parents will have an option of legally transferring there children to other schools. As far as preschool just coming up with creative fun hands on age appropriate activities can be a challenge. There are many books that you can borrow from the library that outline different experiments,etc. for school aged children. Simplicity is the key but still allowing preschoolers to explore and understand the world around them. An example is floating. Putting a raw egg in water and an hard boilded egg and having the students perdict which one will float. There are others that I cannot think of right now but teaching science in preschool is not as hard as one would think. Just talking about plants, animals, magnets, electricity, gravity, etc. is all science related and relevant for when they reach kindergarten on up. D. Middleton First Grade Teacher/Biologist 		"

Mahigit 2,000 taon na ang India at Egypt, pero hikahos. Wala pang 150 taong gulang ang Canada, Australia at New Zealand, pero mauunlad. Ang kaibahan ng mahirap o mayamang bansa ay hindi rin sa likas na yaman. Sa Japan 80% ng teritoryo ay bundok, hindi maaring sakahin o pastulan ng baka, pero ikalawang pinaka-sulong na ekonomiya sa mundo. Tila isang lumulutang na pabrika ang Japan, umaangkat ng raw materials at nagluluwal ng manufactured goods sa buong mundo. Gayundin ang Switzerland, na hindi nagtatanim ng cocoa pero gawaan ng pinaka-bantog na tsokolate sa mundo. Apat na buwan lang sa isang taon natatamnan o napapastulan ang lupa, pero nangunguna ito sa dairy industry. Maliit na bansa pero matatag, maayos at matahimik. Anang expatriates mula sa mayayamang bansa na nakakasalamuha ang katulad sa mahihirap na bansa, wala silang pinagkaiba sa talino. Ang kulay ng balat ay hindi rin mahalaga. Ang mga imigranteng binansagang tamad sa sariling bansa ay pinaka-masisipag sa nilipatan sa Europe. 		"

Anu-ano ang mga aktibong bulkan na matatagpuan sa pilipinas?,"Mga Aktibong Bulkan na matatagpuan sa Pilipinas           â¥ Bulkang Mayon â¥         Matatagpuan sa lalawigan ng  Albay  sa bansang  Pilipinas  and aktibong  Bulkang Mayon . Inihahambing ito sa  Bundok Fuji  ng bansang  Hapon  dahil sa tila perpekto nitong hugis. Matatagpuan ang  Lungsod ng Legazpi  ilang kilometro sa timog nito.   Ayon sa mga  volcanolohigo , isa itong  stratovolcano  o kompositong bulkan. Ang tila simetriko niton kona ay nabuo sa pamamagitan ng pagkapatong-patong ng mga daloy ng  lahar  at  lava . Dahil umaabot ng halos 50 beses na ang mga pagsabog nito sa nakaraang 400 taon, itinuturing itong pinakaaktibong bulkan sa buong bansa.    â¥ Bulkang Taal â¥           Ang Bulkang Taal ay isang aktibong bulkan sa isla ng Luzon sa Pilipinas.

Ano ang mga batas sa pangangalaga ng likas na yaman?,"Ang ganda ng kalikasan ay tunay na yaman   Bahagi na ito ng aking kabataan.   Ito ang pundasyon nang ating kinabukasan.   Kaya't pagsisikapan kong ito'y pagkainggatan.      Ang gubat sa bundok ay gubat ng yaman.   Pagkat sari-saring buhay dito matatagpuan.   Ang sinag ng araw ditto ay walang kasing kinang.   Ang himig ng hangin may dalang katahimikan.      Ang lambak ang aking hardin.   Punong-puno ito nang iba't-ibang pananim.   Madaming bulaklak kahit saan tumingin.   Masustansyang pagkain ang kaniyang hain.      Ang hanging sariwa, naglilinis ng pang-unawa.   Libre lang langhapin, Hindi nakakasawa.   May dalang himig sa musikero't makata,   Na ang alay ay himig at tula.      Ang pagbabago ay Hindi makakamtan,   Kung ang kalikasan ay mapababayaan.   Ito ang lakas ng isip at ng ating katawan.

Ano ang gamot sa sakit na kulugo?,"Ayon sa pag-aaral ang aloe vera ay mabisa, pinakamainam at pinakanatural na paraan upang matanggal ang kulugo. Gumamit ng cotton buds o cotton ball na idiniin sa katas ng halaman ng aloe vera na ipapahid sa bahagi na may kulugo. Gawin ito araw-araw hanggang sa tuluyang mawala ang kulugo. Ang natural acids na taglay ng aloe vera ay nakakapagpalambot sa balat dahilan upang tuluyang gumaling at mawala ang kulugo.   Another Answer:  Isa sa pinaka-karaniwang paraan ng pag-aalis ng kulugo ay ang tinatawag na ""Duct Tape Method.""  Pinupuksa ng asido na nasa adhesive o pandikit na nasa loob ngduct tape and bacteria sa loob ng kulugo.  Paraan: Gumupit ng piraso ng duct tape at ibalot ito sa kulugo sa loob ng anim na araw at makikita agad ang pagbabago sa kulugo. Kung hindi nawala ang kulugo sa loob ng anim na araw, ulitin muli ang proseso hanggang sa tuluyan na itong mawala.  Kung hindi mawala ang kulugo sa ganitong paraan, kumunsulta na sa doktor.  Ang paraang ito ay hindi maaring gawin kung ang kulugo ay nasa maselang bahagi ng katawan.

Binubuo ng 40 bansa ang Asya       kabilang na ang mga pulo at arkipelago. Ito ay nakadugtong sa Europa at Africa.       Kabilang sa mga malalaking bansa sa Asya ang Tsina at India.       Ang Pilipinas ay matatagpuan rin sa Asya      EUROPA    Ang Europa ang pang-anim na pinakamalaking kontinente sa mundo.      Bagamat     isa sa pinakamaliit, matatagpuan sa Europa ang mga bansang      pinakaindustriyalisado     at mayaman. May 32 bansa sa Europa at humigit-kumulang sa 700 milyon      lamang     ang mga tao. Ang Espanya at Italya ay halimbawa ng bansang matatagpuan .

HILAGANG AMERIKA        Ang Hilagang Amerika ang higit na malaki sa dalawang kontinente ng Amerika.       Humahaba ito sa sa mahigit 24 milyong kilometro. Itinuturing ng mga nandayuhang       mula sa Europa ang Hilagang Amerika na ""bagong mundo"" noong mga unang       panahon. Ang Amerika ay ipinangalan kay Amerigo Vespucci, isang Europeong       eksplorador. Binubuo ng 23 nagsasariling bansa ang Hilagang Amerika. Ang United       States of America o Estados Unidos, marahil ang pinakamakapangyarihang bansa sa       mundo, ay matatagpuan sa kontinenteng ito.       TIMOG AMERIKA        Ang Timog Amerika ay karaniwang tinatawag na ""Latin America"". Karamihan       sa mga bansang matatagpuan sa kontinenteng ito ay nagsasalita ng Espanyol na       direktang nagmula sa Latin. Ang Timog Amerika ang pang-apat na pinakamalaking       kontinente. Mayroong itong 12 nagsasariling mga bansa. Matatgapuan sa Timog       Amerika ang pinakamalawak na ekosistem ng kagubatan sa buong mundo, ang       Amazon. Ang ilang bahagi ng pinakatimog na hanggahan ng kontinenteng ito ay       karugtong ng Hilagang Amerika. Ang Brazil at Argentina ay ilan sa mga bansang       matatagpuan sa Timog Amerika.       APRIKA        Ang Africa ang pangalawang pinakamalaking kontinente. Ang mga tuyong       lupain at disyerto ay matatagpuan sa pinakahilagang bahagi samantalang       ang mayayabong na kagubatan ay makikita sa sentro at pinakatimog na       bahagi. Dating itinuturing ng mga Europeo na ""madilim na kontinente"" ang       Africa dahil wala silang alam hinggil dito noong mga unang panahon.       Naniniwala ang mga siyentipiko na ang mga unang tao ay mula sa       kontinenteng ito at kalaunan ay nagtungo sa ibang kontinente. Ang Egypt at       Nigeria ay ilan sa mga bansang matatagpuan sa Africa.       AUSTARLIA        Itong malawak na lupain ay talagang kakaiba. Ito ay isang kontinente, bansa,       at estado. Matatagpuan ito sa timog silangan ng Asia at malapit sa       Antarctica. Ang pangalan ng Australia ay mula sa Latin na tierra australis       incognito, na nangangahulugang ""hindi kilalang lupain sa timog"" para sa       mga sinaunang Europeong manlalakbay. Karaniwang tinutukoy itong ""land       down under"" (lupain sa may ilalim). Bakit kaya sa tingin mo? Tinatawag na       ganoon ang Australia dahil sa lokasyon nito sa ibabang bahagi ng globo.       ANTARTIKA        Ang Antarctica ay kilalang ""frozen continent."" Itinuturing ito na isa sa       iilangpook sa Lupa na hindi naiistorbo ng mga tao. Matatagpuan ito sa       Polong Timog, ang pinakaibabang bahagi ng mundo. Dahil dito, napakahirap       itong marating. Nais mo bang manirahan doon?

"
What happens during an El Niño?,"El NiÃ±o is a weather phenomena which tends to occur in tropical waters of the Pacific Ocean. It affects the region across the Pacific from New Guinea to South America. During an El NiÃ±o season, which occurs on average every 2 - 7 years, a shift in ocean currents and winds brings warm water in a westerly direction, displacing the usual cold water that comes up from the ocean depths. As well as affecting marine life, the El NiÃ±o has an effect on weather patterns.    Under normal conditions, in the tropics warm oceans tend to be accompanied by heavy rains, resulting in heavy rains in the warm west Pacific while the cooler east Pacific receives far less rainfall. This is reversed during an El NiÃ±o, when the ocean temperature gradient from one side of the Pacific to the other weakens. Warmer than usual ocean temperatures cause droughts in the west (e.g. Australia), while the unusually warm eastern waters bring heavy rains and floods to the Pacific coast of South America, which is usually much drier.    It's all a matter of interactions between the oceans and the atmosphere. Changes in sea surface temperatures causes a shift in air pressure which, in turn, can result in climatic anomalies, such as severe droughts, flooding and even cyclones. One of the effects is that the normal circulation patterns over the Pacific are disrupted, and moisture-bearing trade winds weaken, whilst drier westerlies increase.    El NiÃ±o has a number of effects, beyond causing droughts and floods on opposite sides of the Pacific. It causes die-offs of plankton and fish and affects Pacific jet stream winds, altering storm tracks and creating unusual weather patterns in various parts of the world. Scientific investigations of this phenomenon are ongoing, and it is yet to be determined whether El NiÃ±o's primary forcing is oceanic or atmospheric. 		"

What do you do during an 'El Niño'?,"Evacuate  or  Stay in a safe, dry place  may be choice actions during an 'El NiÃ±o' extreme event. The phrase refers to an unusual warming of temperatures in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The event may be accompanied by greater rainfall. So there may be flooding and thunderstorms.  It's important to  travel  as little as possible. If travel is allowed and necessary, voyagers need to have access to informational radio broadcasts. They need to have dependable forms of communication, such as working cell phones. They need to have updated maps, and medical and survival supplies in the vehicle.  The same holds true in terms of the particular form of  shelter , be it one's own home or elsewhere. It's best to keep current on weather advisories. It's important to make sure that family and friends know one's location. And it's important to stay dry, safe and warm. 		"

How acceleration occur in curve pattern?,"Net forces. Consider a velocity - time graph for a person free falling from a plane. Initially, on leaving the plane, the only force is due to the mass of the person under the effect of gravity, f  =  m * g (newtons) and effectively gives an initial acceleration of 1 g (about 10 ((m/s)/s)). As soon as you are in motion however, air resistance will provide an opposing force (proportional to the square of the velocity), reducing the net force providing acceleration, so your velocity increase per second, will be diminished the faster you go. Eventually the air resistance will match the force due to gravity at what is known as terminal velocity, where the net force is 0 and no further acceleration takes place.  :  Force down (constant)  =  mass * acceleration due to gravity. Force up (varies with velocity)  =  velocity 2  * drag coefficient. The same reasoning can be applied to accelerating vehicles, except there are additional forces against due to rolling resistance. an example graph form is v  =  10t - t 2 , t from 0 to 5 		"
How acceleration occur in a straight pattern?,"It just does, in the absence of other forces ( ie air and rolling resistance ), that is to say under ideal conditions, a constant force on a fixed mass will produce uniform acceleration (velocity change) acceleration ( (m/s)/s ) = force (newtons) / mass (kg) 		"
